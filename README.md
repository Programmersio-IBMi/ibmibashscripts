# ibmibashscripts
This repository will be a home for useful bash scripts on IBM i.

This is a learning experience so gentle feedback and your favorite IBM i bash examples would be nice to put here.

One thing you will notice is that I like verbose documentation :-)

Feel free to submit requests or input in the Issues section as well
